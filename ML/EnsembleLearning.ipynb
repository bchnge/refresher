    "- Bayes optimal classifier\n",
    "- Bootstrap aggregating (bagging)\n",
    "    - Each model is built using a distinct random subsample from the training set (thus bootstrapping)\n",
    "    - Each trained model produces a vote.\n",
    "- Boosting\n",
    "    - Sequential learning. Observations from the previous round with larger errors are given larger weights in the subsequent rounds.\n",
    "    - Results are combined in the form of voting\n",
    "- Bayesian model averaging\n",
    "    - Results are a weighted average of multiple models, where the weights of each model are determined using a bayesian prior (often implied by BIC or AIC. models which reduce entropy get larger weights?)\n",
    "- Bayesian model combination\n",
    "    - instead of sampling from models, the prior is a dirichlet distribution (uniform) of model weights. this is more robust than BMA where single models can easily dominate.\n",
    "- Bucket of models\n",
    "    - Choose the single model that produces the best average score..\n",
    "    - for each model in bucket:\n",
    "        - for each cv in cv:\n",
    "            - test/train split in cv\n",
    "            - train, test. return validation score\n",
    "- Stacking\n",
    "    - build a second model which uses the predictions of the first stage models as input.\n",
